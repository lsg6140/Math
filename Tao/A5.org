What does each of the following statements mean, and which of them are true? Can you find gaming metaphors for each of these statements?

(a) For every positive number $x$, and every positive number $y$, we have $y^2=x$.

Any positive number is the square of all positive number. False.

This statement is false, since if $x=1$ and $y=2$, $y^2\neq x$.

Your opponent first picks a positive number $x$, and then you pick arbitrarily a positive number $y$, it is not always $y^2=x$.

(b) There exists a positive number $x$ such that for every positive number $y$, we have $y^2=x$.

A positive number is the square of all positive numbers. False

You pick a positive number first $x$, and then your oppenent can pick a positive number $y$ that $y^2\neq x$ to defeat you.

(c) There exists a positive number $x$, and there exists a positive number $y$, such that $y^2=x$.

A positive number is the square of a positive number. True

Your oppenent pick $4$, and then you pick $2$. You win the game since $2^2=4$.

(d) For every positive number $y$, there exists a positive number $x$ such that $y^2=x$.

Every positive number has a positive square root. True.

Your opponent picks a positive number $x$, and then you pick a positive number $y$. You win if $y^2=x$ and you can always win.

(e) There exists a positive number $y$ such that for every positive number $x$, we have $y^2=x$.

A positive number is a positive square root of all positive numbers. False.

You pick a positive number $y$, and then your oppenent picks a positive number $x$ such that $y^2\neq x$ to defeat you.
