* Ch5: The real numbers
** Lemma 5.1.15
Cauchy sequences are bounded: Every Cauchy sequence \((a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is bounded.
\begin{proof}
There exists \(N\) such that \(j,k\geq N\) implies \(d(a_j,a_k)<\varepsilon\) for all \(\varepsilon\). Therefore, \(-\varepsilon+a_N<a_i<\varepsilon+a_N\) for all \(i>N\). This implies that the infinite sequence \((a_n)_{n=N}^\infty\) is bounded. Finite sequence \((a_n)_{n=1}^{N-1}\) is bounded by Lemma 5.1.14. Therefore, \((a_n)_{n=1}^\infty\) is bounded.
\end{proof}
